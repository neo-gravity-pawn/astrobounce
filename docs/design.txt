Idea:
-----
Basically Match3ish + Asteroids
Game mechanics:
    - Goal: the ship has to destroy all asteroids to progress to the next stage
    - Ship: floaty controls, shots (type/strength depends on mode), special shot
    - Background: a match 3 type field, 1 - 4 normal (strength of shot), 5 special
    - Asteroids: they have types (colors), otherwise standard, bigger ones are slow, smaller ones are fast, but...if they collide, they bounce (yeah)
    - Shooting: the ship shots a shot of a type that depends on the piece of the background it hovers above
Components:
    ‚Åª The background
    - The ship
    - The shot
    - The asteroid
    - The bounce
The technique:
    - Typescript + PixiJS
